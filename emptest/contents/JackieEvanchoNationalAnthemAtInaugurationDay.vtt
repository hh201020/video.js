00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
Oh, say can you see,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
By the dawn's early light,

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
What so proudly we hailed,

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
At twilight's last gleaming?

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,

00:47.500 --> 00:50.000
Through the perilous fight,

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
O'er the ramparts we watched,

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Were so gallantly streaming.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
And the rocket's red glare,

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
The bombs bursting in air,

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Gave proof through the night,

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
That our flag was still there.

01:22.000 --> 01:35.000
Oh, say does that star spangled banner yet wave,

01:35.000 --> 01:56.000
For the land of the free, and the home of the brave.
